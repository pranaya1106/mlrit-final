 * fine for local development but means an EC2 instance replacement — or a
 * second instance behind the load balancer — loses or never sees them. With
 * the bucket set, the disk holds nothing that matters.
 *
 * Credentials are left to the default provider chain rather than read from
 * env: on EC2 that resolves to the instance role, so no long-lived key needs
 * to exist on the host at all. Set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
