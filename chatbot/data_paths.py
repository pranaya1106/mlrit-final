"""
Shared path resolution for chatbot data sources — the Next.js frontend's
lib/*.ts data modules and select app/*/page.tsx files, which the chatbot
reads directly at startup/request time instead of duplicating their content
in a second, hand-typed copy.

FRONTEND_ROOT defaults to the parent of this chatbot/ directory — the local
development layout, where the frontend repo and chatbot/ are siblings. Set the
FRONTEND_ROOT environment variable to an absolute path if the chatbot is ever
deployed without the frontend repository physically alongside it (e.g. a
standalone container/service) — point it at wherever lib/ and app/ were
copied or mounted.

Every module that reads one of these frontend source files should resolve its
path through this module (via `resolve()` or `read_text()`) instead of
hand-building a relative path — one place to fix if the deployment layout
ever changes.
